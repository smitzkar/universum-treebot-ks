# universum-treebot-ks

As the Tech Tales exhibition at the [TU Berlin UNI_VERSUM](https://www.tu.berlin/news/berichte/ein-neuer-ort-der-wissenschaftskommunikation) is coming to an end, it is finally time to collect, preserve, and publish the various little adjustments and repairs we had to make to our projects during its lifetime. 

The [talking-treebot](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/talking-treebot) from [Technologiestiftung Berlin](https://www.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/) had been a bit of a problem child, but we got it to a fairly stable position.
